	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>While studying Bachelor of Architecture at Universidad de Los
		Andes in Colombia I realized I had a deep interest in understanding
		structures involved in architectural design. This is when I started a
		double degree with Civil Engineering, with the idea to understand
		structures and use that to create more integrated and richer
		designs. Majoring in engineering made me also found a passion
		for algorithmic and computational thinking which is why now I
		am enrolled in a Master program in Computational Design at the
		university of applied sciences of Ostwestfalen-Lippe in Germany.
		Here I aim to enrich my knowledge, learning digital fabrication
		methods combined with advanced form finding to align my two
		passions and to develop solutions for the new complexities that the
		world demands of new building projects.</p>
