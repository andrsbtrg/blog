	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>
		While studying Bachelor of Architecture at Universidad de Los
		Andes in Colombia I realized I had a deep interest in
		understanding structures involved in architectural design. This
		is when I started a double degree with Civil Engineering, with
		the idea to understand structures and use that to create more
		integrated and richer designs. Majoring in engineering made me
		also found a passion for algorithmic and computational thinking
		which is why now I am enrolled in a Master program in
		Computational Design at the university of applied sciences of
		Ostwestfalen-Lippe in Germany. Here I aim to enrich my
		knowledge, learning digital fabrication methods combined with
		advanced form finding to align my two passions and to develop
		solutions for the new complexities that the world demands of new
		building projects.
