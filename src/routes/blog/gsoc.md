After hearing about [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) program, I got really excited to learn that there are a few organizations with open source projects for AEC. 

## background

I have never actually contributed before to an open source project, and GSoC seems like a perfect opportunity to start doing it. The 12 week programs offers mentorship to first time open-source contributors and students and it also expects participants to create a detailed proposal of the topic of their contribution. That means: 

- research previous contributions, 
- create a schedule and 
- create a log of their work. 

I think this is neat because the personal experience of being part of something bigger on a project with experienced open source developers.

## how did we got here?
After doing some research on the open source organizations and projects for this year, I discovered that IfcOpenShell, the community behind BlenderBIM and many others, is participating since the last years.

I learned blender around 2019 thanks to Blender Guru. I really appreciate the community behind Blender - the developers, and the content creators - and I think this was the first time I stopped to learn about OSS.

Later on, I started my master's degree at the end of 2020, and our program focused on learning Rhinoceros and Grasshopper for parametric. Since then I got really hardcore into parametric and add-in development. This means I also got really tied into the grasshopper ecosystem and community -  which btw, is great - but I missed a lot of the development going on the OSS side with Blender and Geometry nodes. 

For a long time I thought the only way of doing parametric design was using grasshopper, but the idea to participate on the program this year made me discover a whole new toolset for parametric design and BIM.

Now I am working on a proposal for the Google Summer of Code to continue work done on previous years on BIM Parametric nodes for Blender: [IfcSverchok](https://github.com/IfcOpenShell/IfcOpenShell/tree/v0.7.0/src/ifcsverchok). It is a plug in for [Sverchok](https://github.com/nortikin/sverchok) which is an addon for blender for Parametric Design, and the IFC add-on enables easy IFC authoring and manipulation.

I am very optimistic about contributing this year. Even if it doesn't work out for me, I am happy to have learned about these tools and expanded a little the surface of what I can do.
